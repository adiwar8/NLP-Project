Handwriting Recognition with Grammar Correction


Run handwriting-character-recognition.ipynb for the full page handwriting recognition model.

Run T5_Grammer_C4/Clang.ipynb for creating grammar correction model.
The Clang8 and C4_200M datasets are required for training the grammer correction model.

finally run nlp-project.ipynb which loads both models and does spelling correction using edit distance on the output.
